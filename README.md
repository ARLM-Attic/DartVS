DartAnalysis.NET
=========

A .NET wrapper around Google's Analysis Service for .NET.

## This is waaaaay incomplete. Come back soon!
This project is to support [DartVS, my Dart integration for Visual Studio](https://github.com/DanTup/DartVS).
Both are very much incomplete, and the API of this service is changing frequently. If you choose to use this,
you do so at your own risk, and there is currently no documentation!
